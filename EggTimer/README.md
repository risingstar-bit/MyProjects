## EGG TIMER APP

This is a Egg Shaped Timer App. Here the user gets the chance of setting the time upto max. 10 mins. 
In between 0 to 10 mins the user can set the time limit as per their choice. The App further works when the user taps on the "Go" button. 
Once the time is over the beep sound is been created by the app which helps the user to understand that the time is over and if he/she wants they can again set the timer as 
per their choice by selecting the ending time with the help of SeekBar provided in the app. If someone doesn't wants the noise to be made by the App they can tap on the 
"pausesound" button.
