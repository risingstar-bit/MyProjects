This is a Tic Tac Toe gaming app
here one user can play the game by playing for both the players.
Here 2 circles are being introduced for playing like one is red another yellow,
if the yellow circles come in a straight/diagonal line the game is won by the circles, hence the pop up of "yellow won the game" shows up
the same applies for the red coloured circle too.
If in any case the circles don't come in a straight line or diagonal and all empty boxes are filled then the pop up "the match is draw " will show up.
At last the player get's "play again" button in the bottom of the app by clicking which the player can play the game once more.
